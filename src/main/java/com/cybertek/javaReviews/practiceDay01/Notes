Today:
- OOP :
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    - Abstraction
    - Polymorphism

class: blueprint, general description of objects, template
        * variables / properties / features
        * methods / actions / behaviour
object itself, concrete, real

System.err.println("ERROR : invalid color : " + newColor);
This statement similer to System.out.println, just prints red color (like error statements)

Constructors:
If you don't provide, Compiler provides one for you
If you only have one constructor with parameter then, you need to invoke, create object with parameter


Static vs Instance
Variables:
    Instance variables belongs to the object created from the class, and each object has it's own value for that instance field (exp: color)
    Static variables: they belong to class and each object shares the same value for the static field (exp: localTime)

Methods :
    Instance methods belongs to each object, and they define each different objects actions, can be reached only by an object
    Static Methods belongs to class, can be called with className (and object name, but not preferable)


We can have parent of all the Lights,
but I just want to define general characteristics
        but not every implementation
I create an Abstract Parent Class

        * In abstraction: we want to say what an object should do
        but NOT how it should do it.
